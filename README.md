This Grails app demonstrates interfacing with the Yelp search API and the Google Maps javascript API.

Yelp API requests requires authentication credentials.

To generate authentication credentials, visit http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/authentication

Put the authentication credentials in the following file:
grails-app/conf/oauth.properties.template

Then rename the file to "oauth.properties" before running the app.
